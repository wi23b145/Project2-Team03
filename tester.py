"""
This file contains an example of how you can run your metaheuristic with a bound of n seconds and providing a specific problem instance. Your final submitted algorithm should work with this file
with no issue. Otherwise, it may not be able to participate in the tournament.

Example of how to call this file from the terminal:
python tester.py -d 60 -i instance01.txt

OR

python tester.py --deadline 60 --instance instance01.txt
